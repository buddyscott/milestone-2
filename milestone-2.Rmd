Project #1: https://ryangraff14.shinyapps.io/milestone8/ 

I think this project has great intentions and attempts to answer a question
that a lot of basketball fans constantly wonder: Who won the trade? However,
there are a few immediate I noticed. First off, the arbitrary nature of the
starting year and the few statistics in which the model is based inevitably
is flawed. For example, the model looks at three-point shooting percentage, 
but does not take into account the volume with which three pointers were taken,
if the player is great but does not attempt threes, or control for the recent
uptick in three point shooting in the last decade or so. Secondly, it does not
do a good job attempting to be more applicable to broader data science and
admittedly seems to only appeal to die-hard basketball fans like myself.
Also, the project does not explain how these complicated advanced stats 
such as VORP and BPM are calculated. Lastly, the video could have been a lot 
more professional, like using a screen record instead of holding a camera 
towards your computer.
